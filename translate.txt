If it is about help, not only me everyone was taking help from other trainees then why you are pointing only at me?
And as i said i only took help to install mySQL workbench and i am accepting that. In fact except me other trainees actually 
took help from other trainees. If you don't trust me then i insist to check camera thenafter you will have clear picture because of that you will be able to understand the clear scenerio. Apart from that Bhargav sir also saw all of them that they were helping he also said NO to them after that i didn't take any help from anyone and that's for sure. After that when urvish sir came , he saw that all trainees are taking help from others but i was not there at that time who was taking help.
