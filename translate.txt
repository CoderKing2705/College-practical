If it is about help, I accepted it because I sought the help to install workbench only and nothing else. Others were also taking help, not only me. So why question on me only?
In cctv, you can check who has taken how much help. It will be clear that I had taken the least help even that was for tool installation and that should not be considered as cheating.
Even bhargav sir came and saw that we are seeking help of others and he asked not to do so. After that I didn't take help. 
After that, urvish sir also came for evaluation, at that time also, I was not seeking any help and others were doing so.Â  
So, it's a kind request that cctv footage should be viewed because everything will be cleared from that. Even the one who had the exam there, he himself was not available at his desk and other trainees were using his computer. 

Also, just because I accepted I had taken help that doesn't mean who has put allegations on me, is right. Being loyal, I agreed to take help for the tool installation. That doesn't mean I copied.
