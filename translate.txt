If it's about assistance, everyone was receiving assistance from other trainees, so why are you pointing just at me?
And, as I previously stated, I only needed assistance to install mySQL workbench, which I accept. Except for me, the other trainees did seek assistance from one another. If you don't believe me, I insist on checking the camera. Once you get a clear picture, you will be able to understand the clear scenerio. Apart from that, Bhargav sir witnessed all of them helping and said NO to them. After that, I didn't take any help from anyone, for sure. When Urvish Sir arrived, he found that everything was in order.
