If it is about assistance, I accepted it because I only wanted to install workbench. Others, not just myself, were seeking assistance. So why focus only on me? You can see who has taken how much assistance in cctv. So, it is a gracious request that CCTV footage should be seen because it will clear everything up. It will be evident that I took the least amount of assistance, even it was for tool installation, and this should not be deemed cheating.
Even Bhargav Sir came and observed that we were seeking assistance from others and toldÂ us not to do. So, I refused to accept assistance. Following that, Urvish sir came for evaluation; at the time, I was not seeking assistance, while others were. Even the one who was giving exam, he himself was not available at his desk and other trainees were using his computer. Also, just because I admitted to taking assistance does not indicate that whoever made the claims against me is correct. Being loyal, I agreed to take help for the tool installation. That doesn't mean I copied.
